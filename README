Microarray version 0.45
=======================

Microarray is a suite of object oriented Perl Modules for the handling and analysis of microarray experiment data. These include modules for handling common formats of microarray files, modules for the programmatic abstraction of a microarray experiment, and for the output of a variety of images describing microarray experiment data. 

This distribution is not yet fully tested; there are 8 test scripts that cover 14 of the 18 modules included in this distribution, although only 10 of those modules are covered in detail. However, the data files required for execution of the majority of the tests are not included in this distribution because of their size, but instead they are available for download from our Laboratory's web site at the following address;
